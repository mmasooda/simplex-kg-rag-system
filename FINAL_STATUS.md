## 🔬 **TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS**

### **1. Multi-Strategy Retrieval**
```
Entity Linking → Path Retrieval → Cypher Execution → Triplet Analysis
     ↓              ↓                ↓                  ↓
Confidence: 0.9   0.6              0.8               0.7
```

### **2. Iterative Quality Improvement**
```
Iteration 1: Initial entity discovery
Iteration 2: Relationship exploration + context refinement  
Iteration 3: Technical specification validation
Final: Quality comparison with baseline RAG
```

### **3. Advanced Context Management**
- **Fact Deduplication**: Prevents redundant information
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted by retrieval method and data quality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each iteration adds valuable context
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents unnecessary iterations when no new facts found

### **Test Query 1**: Office Building
```
"I need a fire alarm system for a 10-story office building with 200 rooms"
```
**Result**: Comprehensive technical analysis with specific Simplex products

### **Test Query 2**: Specific Products
```
"I need Simplex 4090-9001 smoke detectors with the 4100ES panel"
```
**Result**: Detailed compatibility analysis and technical specifications

### **Test Query 3**: Complex Requirements
```  
"Design a fire alarm system for a hospital with operating rooms and patient areas"
```
**Result**: Multi-iteration analysis considering specialized requirements
