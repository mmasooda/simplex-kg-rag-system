Answer: For smoke detectors with relay bases, I recommend the **Simplex 4098-9754** photoelectric smoke detector, which can be used with a relay base for enhanced functionality. 

You can pair it with the **Simplex 4098-9734** relay base. This combination allows for the smoke detector to activate external devices or systems when smoke is detected, providing an effective solution for fire alarm systems.

### Key Features:
- **4098-9754 Smoke Detector**: 
  - Photoelectric sensing technology for improved detection of smoldering fires.
  - Compatible with Simplex fire alarm control panels.

- **4098-9734 Relay Base**:
  - Provides a relay output for external signaling or control.
  - Easy installation and integration with the smoke detector.

This setup will ensure reliable smoke detection with the added benefit of relay activation for alarms or other connected systems.
